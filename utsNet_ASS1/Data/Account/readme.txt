use the folder file Main_to_Run 

step one 
install all the import file and set mrccn to your root folder

step 2 instal h5py v2.10 and reset the runtime

step 3 make sure you have mask_rcnn_coco.h5 in your file path or else download it 

step 4
 
if you face missing image just delete all dataset and add a new one if you still face the same issue you have to run this 
code in your local device because i believe google could not read the file fast enough  )

step 5 
all the output of the .h5 file will be save at aravinthan/Main_to_run/mrcnn
